# Engineering Log

## Session 1 - June 9, 2026
### Accomplished
- Created GitHub repository
- Installed Python
- Created virtual environment
- Installed OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib
- Created first image loading program

### Problems
- VS Code wasn't using the virtual environment
- OpenCV couldn't find the image because of the file path
- Webcam not accessible through WSL

### Solutions
- Selected correct Python interpreter
- Fixed image path
- Decided to postpone webcam setup

### Next Session
- How does an arUco marker work?
- How can an arUco marker be read?





## Session 2 - June 11, 2026
### Accomplished
- Learned how ArUco detection works
- Generated a marker with ID 0
- Successfully detected marker ID 0
- Retrieved marker corner coordinates

### Problems:
- Marker without border could not be detected

### Debugging:
- Verified image loaded correctly.
- Verified detector object creation.
- Printed rejected candidate count.
- Determined marker required surrounding white border.

### Solution:
- Added white border around marker image

### Next Session
- How do i use the marker corner coordinates to find position errors for the drone?
